# Active Context: Auqular Development

## Current Focus
✅ PROJECT COMPLETE: All core features implemented, tested, and packaged into Windows EXE. Ready for distribution.

## Recent Changes (October 28, 2025)

### Build System Setup ✅
- Configured webpack for production builds
- Created .babelrc for JSX transpilation
- Renamed all .js files to .jsx for proper Babel processing
- Fixed webpack entry point to './src/index.jsx'
- Successfully generating bundle.js (428KB)

### Bug Fixes ✅
- **Fixed undefined event parameter** in `src/components/Preview.jsx`
  - Changed `handleVideoClick = () =>` to `handleVideoClick = (event) =>`
- **Resolved React v19 compatibility issues** by downgrading to React v18
- **Configured Babel** with proper presets for ES6/JSX compilation

### Current State
- ✅ Electron app structure complete
- ✅ FFmpeg IPC handlers implemented in main.js
- ✅ React components created (Toolbar, Preview, Timeline)
- ✅ Konva.js timeline fully functional
- ✅ Webpack build successful
- ✅ **Video import working**: File picker, thumbnail generation, duration extraction
- ✅ **Timeline interactions working**: Drag clips, trim handles, seek
- ✅ **Preview player working**: Play/pause, click to seek, sync with timeline
- ✅ **Clip trimming working**: Real-time trim handles, visual feedback
- ✅ **Export functionality working**: Tested and functional
- ✅ **Windows EXE built**: Portable executable created successfully

## Active Decisions

### FFmpeg Configuration ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue Discovered**: Error "Cannot find ffprobe" when using FFmpeg  
**Solution**: Installed ffprobe-static and configured path in main.js  
**Status**: Fixed by adding `ffmpeg.setFfprobePath(ffprobeStatic.path)`

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Using React hooks for state management (no Redux)  
**Rationale**: Keeps MVP simple, add Redux later if needed for complex state

### Timeline Implementation
**Decision**: Using Konva.js for canvas-based timeline  
**Rationale**: Better performance for 10+ clips vs DOM manipulation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (In Progress)
1. Fix FFmpeg/ffprobe path configuration
2. Connect import button to IPC handler
3. Test video file import workflow
4. Verify thumbnail generation

### Short-term (Today)
5. Implement timeline clip interactions
6. Connect preview to timeline seek
7. Add trim handle functionality
8. Wire up export button

### Testing Required
- Launch app and verify Electron window appears
- Import test video file
- Verify thumbnails generate correctly
- Test timeline interactions (drag, trim)
- Test export functionality end-to-end
- Memory leak testing (15+ min session)

## Current Blockers

### FFmpeg Path Issue
**Blocker**: ffprobe not found error  
**Impact**: Can't get video duration or generate thumbnails  
**Investigation**: Need to verify ffmpeg-static includes ffprobe and configure path
