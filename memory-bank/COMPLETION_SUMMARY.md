## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Core Stack
- Electron v39.0 - Desktop framework
- React v18.3 - UI components
- Konva.js v10 - Timeline canvas
- fluent-ffmpeg v2.1 - Video processing

### Build Tools
- Webpack v5.102 - Bundling

### Dependencies
- ffmpeg-static v5.2 - Bundled FFmpeg
- ffprobe-static v3.1 - Bundled ffprobe
- react-konva v18 - Konva React bindings

## 📝 Known Limitations

### Non-Critical
- Bundle size exceeds web standards (acceptable for desktop)
- No file drag/drop (file picker only)
- Export progress not visible in UI (logged to console)
- Unsigned executable (Windows may show warnings)

### Platform
- Windows-only build
- Requires Windows 10 or 11
- Some harmless GPU cache errors in console

## 🚀 Distribution Notes

### First Run
- Windows may show SmartScreen warning (unsigned binary)
- Users should click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Consider code signing for wider distribution

### Usage
- Portable: No installation needed
- Self-contained: No external dependencies
- Can be moved anywhere on the system
