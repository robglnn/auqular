## Known Issues 🐛

### Critical
✅ **MediaRecorder API Incompatibility - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: MediaRecorder does not work in Electron v39
- **Symptoms**: State stays 'inactive', no data collected, stream becomes inactive
- **✅ Solution**: Canvas frame capture + FFmpeg conversion
- **Status**: Webcam recording now works perfectly!

✅ **Frame Capture Loop Synchronization - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: Frame capture loop started before `isRecording` state updated
- **Symptoms**: "No frames captured" error, recording timer running but no data
- **✅ Solution**: Used `recordingActiveRef` instead of async `isRecording` state
- **Status**: Frame capture now works immediately

✅ **FFmpeg Codec/Container Mismatch - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: H.264 codec (`libx264`) incompatible with WebM container
- **Symptoms**: "ffmpeg exited with code 1: Conversion failed!"
- **✅ Solution**: Changed output format from WebM to MP4, added `-movflags +faststart`
- **Status**: Video conversion now works perfectly

### Non-Critical
✅ **Screen Recording Implementation - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: getDisplayMedia API not working in Electron
- **Solution**: Used desktopCapturer API + getUserMedia with Electron constraints
- **Status**: Screen recording now works perfectly!

### Non-Critical
- Bundle size warning (acceptable for desktop app - 429KB)
- DevTools console errors (harmless cache and autofill warnings)
- GPU cache errors in Electron (harmless, common on Windows)
- No export progress UI yet (progress logged to console)
- No drag/drop for files (only file picker works)

## Testing Status
- ❌ Unit tests - Not implemented (optional)
- ❌ Integration tests - Not implemented (optional)
- ✅ Manual testing - Completed successfully
- ⏳ Memory leak testing - Recommended for production
- ⏳ Performance testing - Recommended for production

## Performance Metrics
- Launch time: Unknown (need to measure)
- Build time: ~6-8 seconds
- Bundle size: 428KB (acceptable)
- Preview FPS: Unknown (not yet implemented)
- Timeline responsiveness: Unknown (not yet tested)

## Next Session Goals
1. Fix FFmpeg/ffprobe configuration
2. Implement working video import
3. Test import → preview → timeline flow
4. Implement basic trim functionality
5. Connect export button with progress UI
