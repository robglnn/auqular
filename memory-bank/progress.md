## Known Issues 🐛

### Critical - Blocking Core Workflow 🚨

🚨 **Video Preview Black Screen During Playback**
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Blocking core editing workflow
- **Description**: Video element displays black screen during active playback but shows correctly when paused
- **Impact**: Cannot see video content while editing, severely limits usability
- **Technical Details**:
  - Video element loads successfully (logs confirm playback started)
  - CSS styles set: `display: 'block'`, `visibility: 'visible'`, `opacity: '1'`
  - May be related to video element state, CSS layering, or rendering pipeline
- **Next Steps**: Investigate video element rendering, CSS z-index/layering, Electron video playback quirks

🚨 **Drag and Drop File Import Failure**
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Blocks convenient file import workflow
- **Description**: Files dragged from Windows Explorer show red X cursor and drop fails
- **Impact**: Users must use file picker button instead of convenient drag/drop
- **Technical Details**:
  - Event handlers attached to window, document, body with `{ passive: false, capture: true }`
  - Comprehensive logging added but drop events not being captured
  - May require Electron main process handler or different event capture strategy
- **Next Steps**: Research Electron drag/drop best practices, consider IPC-based file handling

### Critical
✅ **MediaRecorder API Incompatibility - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: MediaRecorder does not work in Electron v39
- **Symptoms**: State stays 'inactive', no data collected, stream becomes inactive
- **✅ Solution**: Canvas frame capture + FFmpeg conversion
- **Status**: Webcam recording now works perfectly!

✅ **Frame Capture Loop Synchronization - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: Frame capture loop started before `isRecording` state updated
- **Symptoms**: "No frames captured" error, recording timer running but no data
- **✅ Solution**: Used `recordingActiveRef` instead of async `isRecording` state
- **Status**: Frame capture now works immediately

✅ **FFmpeg Codec/Container Mismatch - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: H.264 codec (`libx264`) incompatible with WebM container
- **Symptoms**: "ffmpeg exited with code 1: Conversion failed!"
- **✅ Solution**: Changed output format from WebM to MP4, added `-movflags +faststart`
- **Status**: Video conversion now works perfectly

### Non-Critical
✅ **Screen Recording Implementation - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: getDisplayMedia API not working in Electron
- **Solution**: Used desktopCapturer API + getUserMedia with Electron constraints
- **Status**: Screen recording now works perfectly!

### Non-Critical
✅ **FFmpeg Packaging Issue - SOLVED!**
- **Issue**: Windows EXE missing FFmpeg binaries causing "spawn ffprobe.exe ENOENT" error
- **Symptoms**: Video import failed with "Cannot find ffprobe" error
- **✅ Solution**: Updated electron-builder config to use `extraResources` instead of `files`, enhanced main.js with `app.isPackaged` detection
- **Status**: EXE now includes proper FFmpeg binaries and works correctly

### Medium Priority

⚠️ **Export Timeline Positioning Not Accurate**
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Added adelay filters for audio positioning and dynamic audio probing
- **Description**: Audio clips starting before video get forced to video start in export
- **Impact**: Exported videos don't match what user sees in timeline
- **Details**: Export uses timelineStart/timelineEnd but FFmpeg filter chain may not be correctly applying positioning
- **Next Steps**: Review FFmpeg filter chain for tpad padding, verify timeline offset calculations

⚠️ **Video Black Screen When No Audio Clip**
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Preview shows black instead of video when playhead over video but no audio clip
- **Description**: When only video clip is at playhead position (no overlapping audio), preview shows black screen
- **Impact**: Cannot preview video-only sections properly
- **Details**: May be related to clip selection logic or Preview component rendering conditions
- **Next Steps**: Review clip selection logic and Preview component conditional rendering

### Low Priority

⚠️ **Horizontal Scrollbar Buggy**
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Functional but has positioning/threshold bugs
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue, users can still navigate but experience is inconsistent
- **Details**: Scrollbar thumb positioning and drag calculation may need refinement

⚠️ **Shift+Mouse Wheel Horizontal Scroll Inconsistent**
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Sometimes doesn't scroll horizontally when Shift+Wheel
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue, scrollbar provides alternative navigation
- **Details**: Event detection or delta calculation may need adjustment

### Non-Critical
- DevTools console errors (harmless cache and autofill warnings)
- GPU cache errors in Electron (harmless, common on Windows)

#### Non-Critical
- System audio recording tabled (configuration issues; microphone works)

## Testing Status
