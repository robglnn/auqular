# Audio Playback Fix - Three Critical Solutions Implemented

## Problem
Cannot hear audio when playing imported WAV files in the Auqular application.

## Root Cause Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, three potential issues were identified:

### 1. **Audio Element Configuration Missing** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The HTML5 `<audio>` element lacked explicit volume and muted state configuration.
- Audio element had no `muted={false}` or volume initialization
- Default state might be muted or volume 0 in Electron's WebView
- No explicit initialization on mount

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `muted={false}` to audio element JSX
- Added initialization useEffect to set `audio.muted = false` and `audio.volume = 1.0` on mount
- Explicitly set volume and muted state before playback
- Double-check volume/muted state after audio loads and starts playing

### 2. **Audio Device Exclusivity on Windows** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Windows WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API) can have exclusive mode conflicts where recording processes hold onto audio devices, preventing playback.
- `mic` package and SoX processes might keep audio device open
- Even stopped recording processes can block playback on Windows
- No check or cleanup before attempting playback

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added IPC handler `is-audio-recording-active` to check for active recording
- Before playing audio, check if system/microphone recording is active
- If active, stop recording and wait 200ms for Windows to release the audio device
- Prevents exclusive mode conflicts

### 3. **Race Condition in Audio Loading/Playback** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Audio source loading and playback timing issues.
- Audio element might try to play before `canplaythrough` event
- `loadedmetadata` might not fire correctly for WAV files
- File path format `file:///` might have issues on Windows

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed from `loadedmetadata` to `canplaythrough` event (more reliable)
- Added proper waiting logic if `readyState < 2` (HAVE_CURRENT_DATA)
- Enhanced retry logic with proper error handling
- Added console logging to debug audio loading states
- Double-check volume/muted state after events fire

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Preview.jsx**
   - Added audio initialization useEffect
   - Enhanced play/pause handler with recording conflict detection
   - Improved audio source loading with `canplaythrough` event
   - Added explicit volume/muted state management throughout

2. **main.js**
   - Added `is-audio-recording-active` IPC handler
   - Returns recording status for system audio and microphone

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Import a WAV file
- [ ] Click play on the audio clip
- [ ] Verify audio can be heard
- [ ] Check browser console for audio state logs
- [ ] Test after stopping a recording session
- [ ] Test multiple audio clips in sequence
- [ ] Verify audio continues playing through timeline

## Console Debug Output

The fix includes console logging to help diagnose issues:
- `Audio loaded - volume: X muted: Y readyState: Z`
- `Starting audio playback - volume: X muted: Y readyState: Z`
- `✅ Audio playback started successfully`
- `⚠️ Audio recording is active - this may block playback`

## Additional Notes

- All solutions work together - each addresses a different potential failure point
- Windows audio exclusivity is the most likely culprit for silent playback
- The 200ms delay after stopping recording gives Windows time to release the device
- Volume is set multiple times as defensive programming to ensure it sticks
